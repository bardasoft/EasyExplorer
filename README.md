# EasyExplorer
An easy Windows Explorer component for .NET apps.

EasyExplorer is the easiest way to integrate Windows Explorer functionality into your app. The component is configurable, and events are provided for all user actions such as navigating folders, opening files, etc. All credits go to [Steven Roebert](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15059/C-File-Browser) for building this component in 2006.
